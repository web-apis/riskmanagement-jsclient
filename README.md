This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

The application is written as a single page Application in JavaScript; to run it you need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To install all required dependencies, run in the project directory:

### `npm install`

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run a server on localhost to deliver the application. If a browser window does not open automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
